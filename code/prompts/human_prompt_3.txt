Generate a mind map of the given scientific paper in the JSON format as in the following example:
{
  "A new algorithm for text tree edit distance based on Zhang-Shasha's algorithm and BERT-like model embedding similarity.": {
    "The algorithm's novelty is in its similarity measure based on BERT-like model embeddings.": {
      "Embedding distance is used as a measure of semantic similarity.": {},
      "The language model allows to capture semantic meaning of sentences and model their similarity.": {}
    },
    "Zhang-Shasha's algorithm is used to compute tree edit distance with new edit costs.": {
      "Semantic similarity is used as the update cost in the algorithm.": {},
      "The costs of insertion and removal of nodes are defined as the similarity of the node and an empty sentence.": {}
    },
    "The proposed algorithm is presented as a more informative metric of similarity between text trees.": {
      "The current ways of comparing text trees overlook overlook their tree structure or the meaning of their labels.": {},
      "This new method can be used, for example, to compare mind maps or hierarchical summaries.": {}
    }
  }
}
The purpose of the mind map is to allow the user to study the paper from key points to more specific details.
Make sure the map is concise and has no more than three levels of hierarchy. Here is the paper you shoud summarize:
